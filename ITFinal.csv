The following illustration will explain the TDS mechanism. Illustration Mr. Raja has made a fixed deposit with XYZ Bank. Annual interest on the deposit is Rs. 8,40,000. Will the bank be liable to deduct any tax from the interest paid to Mr. Raja?**Interest on fixed deposit is covered under the TDS mechanism and, hence, the bank has to deduct tax from interest and has to pay the net interest to Mr. Raja.  The rate of TDS on interest is 10% and, hence, the bank will deduct tax of Rs. 84,000 from the interest and will pay the net interest of Rs. 7,56,000 (i.e., Rs. 8,40,000  Rs. 84,000) to Mr. Raja. The TDS of Rs. 84,000 will be paid by the bank to the Government and Rs. 84,000 will be treated as prepaid tax of Mr. Raja and he can claim tax credit of Rs. 84,000 just like advance tax at the time of filing his return of income.

Also, the signer of a document cannot later disown it by claiming that the signature was forged. In other words, digital signatures enable the ""authentication"" and ""non-repudiation"" of digital messages, assuring the recipient of a digital message of both the identity of the sender and the integrity of the message. A digital signature is issued by a Certification Authority (CA) and is signed with the CA's private key. A digital signature typically contains the: Owner's public key, the Owner's name, Expiration date of the public key, the Name of the issuer (the CA that issued the Digital ID), Serial number of the digital signature, and the digital signature of the issuer. Digital signatures deploy the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology. If you file electronically using digital signature you do not have to submit a physical copy of the ITR-V (Acknowledgment).

However, you must also physically submit the printed and duly signed ITR-V (Acknowledgment) of your e-Filed Income Tax Return."
